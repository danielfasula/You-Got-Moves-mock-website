          <h4>How can we do that you ask?</h4>
          <p>Every single Movement Artist has the tools inside of them to express themselves through their art. We are
            only
            here to
            refine those tools and sharpen your skills with them. We are here to provide you the regimens and the
            formulas
            that our
            coaches used to progress in their own art!</p>
          <h4>Who are your coaches?</h4>
          <p>Great question! We have gathered experienced veterans of various dance styles and flow arts who have been
            certified and
            trained to pass their secrets to you right on your phone or computer!</p>
          <h4>So this is online?</h4>
          <p>Yes! Once you book a lesson, you will receive an email with a Google Calendar invite that includes a
            "Google
            Hangout"
            attachment. All you have to do is join the chatroom link provided in the email when it is time for your
            lesson!</p>
          <h4>What kind of classes do you offer?</h4>
          <p>There are two main types of classes on You Got Moves. Structured Topics, and Open Consults.
            Structured Topics: - Each coach offers specific expertise in various ideas within their movement art. Each
            structured
            lesson will contain an explanation of the idea, along with drills, examples and formulas needed for you to
            develop your
            own style with the tools they give you.
            Open Consults - This is where you just get to pick your coach's brain! Have a recent performance video
            ready
            to
            present
            to them, tell them what you want to learn, or where you want to go and the two of you spend your session
            developing a
            plan for you to follow and take with you to grow as a movement artist.</p>

          <h4>What if I don't feel like I'm ready for a lesson?</h4>
          <p>That's totally okay! We have taken the time to gather quite a few videos that are publicy available on <i
              class="fab fa-youtube"></i> Youtube for you to look through!</p>
          <h4>Free Content you say?</h4>
          <p>Yes! You Got Moves is currently developing our own tutorials for our viewers, and we look forward to
            sharing
            them with
            you! In the meantime, we have scoured the vastness of YouTube to collect and organize a large selection of
            videos that
            we feel can give you more than enough to study and learn from if live coaches aren't your particular cup of
            tea. We
            call is our Community Tutorial Library</p>
          <h4>Do I have to be quiet in this library</h4>
          <p>Of course not, go nuts! However, these pages are loaded with YouTube Videos, so if you are not on WiFi it
            may take a
            moment to load. Not to worry, the content is worth the wait!</p>
